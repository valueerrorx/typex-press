## php online filemanager without sql 

this is a very old but powerfull project of mine

just copy all of the files to your webroot

login with 
username: admin
password: admin' 

change admin password and create a user!

_make sure the following files/folders are set to read/write:_

- /tp-users
- /tp-scripts/include/config.php
- /tp-scripts/include/users.php


good luck - have fun
